-- Fix Foreign Key Relationship for Team Members
-- Copy and paste this entire block into Supabase SQL Editor

-- Step 1: Add foreign key constraint (team_memberships.user_id â†’ user_profiles.id)
ALTER TABLE team_memberships 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_team_memberships_user_profiles 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Step 2: Test the relationship works correctly (with correct column names)
-- Note: user_profiles has full_name but NO email column
-- Email is stored in auth.users table instead
SELECT 
    tm.id,
    tm.user_id,
    tm.role,
    tm.status,
    up.full_name,
    au.email
FROM team_memberships tm
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON tm.user_id = up.id
LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON tm.user_id = au.id::uuid
LIMIT 5;

-- Step 3: Alternative test query (only name, no email if above fails)
SELECT 
    tm.id,
    tm.user_id,
    tm.role,
    tm.status,
    up.full_name
FROM team_memberships tm
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON tm.user_id = up.id
LIMIT 5;

-- Step 4: Verify foreign key constraint was created successfully
